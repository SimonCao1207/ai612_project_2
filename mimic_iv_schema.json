Date of death is extracted from two sources: the hospital information system and the Massachusetts State Registry of Vital Records and Statistics.\nIndividual patient records from MIMIC were matched to the vital records using a custom algorithm based on identifiers including name, social security number, and date of birth.. As a result of the linkage, out of hospital mortality is available for MIMIC-IV patients up to one year post-hospital discharge. All patient deaths occurring more than one year after hospital discharge are censored.\nSurvival studies should incorporate this into their design."
